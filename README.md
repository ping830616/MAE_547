# MAE_547
Modelling and Control of Robots at Arizona State University

- Defining the robot configuration with/without DH parameters (you would need to 
find the DH parameters if the user does not know those, then plot the robotic arm 
so the user can verify it) 
- Finding the governing equations analytically (deriving and outputting equations 
of motion as described in class) 
- Simulating dynamics of the system (plotting q, q_dot, q_ddot for a desired input 
as a function of time) 
- Indirect force control through compliance control: PD control with gravity 
compensation under interactive forces with the environment (plot desired vs 
actual end-effector position as well as end-effector contact forces as a function of 
time)
- Indirect force control through impedance control: inverse dynamics control under 
interactive forces with the environment (plot desired vs actual end-effector 
position as well as end-effector contact forces as a function of time) 
- Easy to use and intuitive GUI
- Clear and detailed report (Step-by-step instruction as in a user manual, 
contribution of each team member, references)
